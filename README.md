## Why WLED+

**WLED+** is developed by [Pixel Heart](https://pixelheart.ai) - a [1-person](https://x.com/tokudu) team in *Venice, CA*. **The goal of this project is to provide the WLED community with a more user-friendly alternative to the official WLED app** that relies strictly on the [JSON](https://kno.wled.ge/interfaces/json-api/) & [WebSocket](https://kno.wled.ge/interfaces/websocket/) APIs that WLED offers.

> The official WLED app and other alternatives rely on the browser to control your devices via the standard Web UI served directly from each controller. While the Web UI works well for basic tasks, its performance & capabilities are limited by the low-cost nature of the hardware that it runs on, and it can‚Äôt evolve without firmware updates.

While WLED+ is opinionated and closed-source, the name of the app was intentially chosen to be similar to WLED to help promote the project and maintain its brand. **WLED is awesome** and all credit for its development goes to [@aircookie](https://github.com/Aircoookie) and [other amazing contributors](https://kno.wled.ge/about/contributors/).

## WLED+ Features

**WLED+** offers a number of additional features compared to the official WLED app & other alternatives:

- **üóÇÔ∏è¬†Layout Management**
	- *Layouts* are unique segment configurations found across your saved presets.
	- You can switch between saved *Layouts* when creating new presets.
	- Segments within each *Layout* can be configure all together, as groups (sets) or individually
	- Creating new *Layouts* is easier thanks to a smarter strategy for adding new segments that automatically finds gaps in the layout or splits largest segments.
- üìö¬†**Library Management**
	- When creating new presets, you can immediately add them to a playlist.
	- Editing or creating playlists is much faster thanks to the improved UI.
	- When browsing presets, you can filter them by layout (ie: segment configuration) or sort them by recency, effect or palette.
- **üìå Quick Load Toolbar**
	- All presets marked for Quick Load can be managed in one place
- **üõ†Ô∏è Lots of Smaller Usability Tweaks**
